# LDhop

This is a meta package for @ldhop

By installing it, you will install other @ldhop packages:

- [`@ldhop/core`](https://npmjs.com/package/@ldhop/core)

It may reference older package versions, or install stuff that you don't need, so it's probably better if you install the @ldhop packages directly as you need.
